ummmmmmmm Hello World
I am currently treating the original Darkstalkers OVA (1997), on youtube, as background noise,
as I casually make my way through Learn Python The Hard Way.

The date is October 4th, 2022.
And, I am stuck on the section of Old Style String Formats.
And, also, in the process of seeking to better understand them, ...
I am having difficulty digesting decimal and floating point and complex number types, and, as they relate to formatting.

I'm reading some documentation to try and better wrap my head around it, however, I am ...
uncertain that I am directing my attention efficiently.

Gonna try and look up some python projects here on github to seek examples from experienced programmers.

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
